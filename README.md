# React-Portfolio

This React-based application is a coding and art portfolio to showcase some of my projects. Deployed to Netlify, this application can be accessed by the user to view my contact info, 6 of my recent coding projects with GitHub links and images attached, as well as some of my artwork for a little flare.
